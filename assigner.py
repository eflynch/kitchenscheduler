'''
This module contains two classes for assigning a set of people to a set of assignments.
The kind of problem this is meant to tackle is, for example, assigning 50 people to
50 jobs in a community kitchen based on their preferences and constraints. This module
uses a lot of array based calculations and so it requires that you have "numpy" installed
and in your $PYTHONPATH.

To you use this module, create an instance of ConstraintsTable which will contain the list
of assignments, the list of people, and the list of constraints and preferences. You can
initialize it with a list of assignments or people or both or neither. In any case, you
then need to put in the constraints by calling ConstraintsTable().addPreference() for each
preference.

Once the ConstraintsTable is prepared, create an instance of Scheduler() passing the
constraints table as an argument. Then call Scheduler().optimalSolution() which will
return what the Scheduler class has determined to be the optimal solution in the form
of a fully constrained instance of ConstraintsTable. Scheduler also has a handy method
for printing what the assignments from a fully constrained ConstraintsTable called
showSolution().

Scheduler uses a randomized greedy algorithm to compute solutions. In each iteration, it
selects a candidate for an assignment from a list by a lottery weighted by preference. Tuning
the preference scale has an enormous effect on the number of solutions this algorithm finds. In
general, preference values that are small (1-5) seem to work better.
